     Since 2022, I have been in the hybrid role of team leader and project manager in our "Implementation of heating and cooling systems" team. Together we realize renewable projects in the city of Berlin. 
     My team currently consists of 8 employees. 
     In our team we live the values of trust, cooperation and being able to fully rely on each other. We benefit from our different backgrounds, professional experiences and expertise. 
     Together, we are driving the heat turnaround in Berlin.

      I projected belt dryer systems for applications in the chemical and food industry worldwide. My tasks included establishing quotations and engineering dry processes. I managed projects from start to finish. Part of it was defining the project's goal with the customers on site followed by the specifications of the dryer system. This also included choosing component suppliers and change management.
