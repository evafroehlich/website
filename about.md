     Since 2022, I have been in the hybrid role of team leader and project manager in our "Implementation of heating and cooling systems" team. Together we realize renewable projects in the city of Berlin. 
     My team currently consists of 8 employees. 
     In our team we live the values of trust, cooperation and being able to fully rely on each other. We benefit from our different backgrounds, professional experiences and expertise. 
     Together, we are driving the heat turnaround in Berlin.

      I managed a small team of engineers and administrative staff. Together with our head of accounting, we introduced new management methods to optimise work processes and reduce project costs.
      In addition I obtained the representation power of attorny (Vertrauensvollmacht) concerning decisions within our projects.
      During my time at beta, I have realised combined heat and power plant projects with my team, for which I have full responsibility. The projects each supply 30 to 50 terraced houses with heat and electrity.

       I wrote my thesis at overspeed GmbH & Co.KG. Their services and products span the entire wind energy sector from wind energy consulting to wind power predictions for grid operators – from the development of wind farm management software to energy storage systems and professional training. 
       In my master's thesis, I analyse a given wind-hydrogen storage model in MatLab using different system configurations. These configurations include changes in the electrolyzer and fuel cell outpu as well as the use of various current and day-ahead forecast data. The aim is to work out the influence of these components on the storage system.
       Furthermore, it is ask which forecast data sets result in the most favourable system behavior. For this purpose, 5-minute, 30-minute averaged forecasts and forecasts with a exceedance probability of 90%, 50% and 10% are used. The storage system will be integrated into wind farms in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia.

      <p class="experience__thesis-description">
        My bachelor's thesis deals with the serviceability and, in particular, the temperature resistance of the primary sealant used in the edge seal of the glazing. For this purpose, the edge seal is thermally loaded in a high-temperature load test rig over a longer period of time and the ageing behaviour of the edge seal is investigated during this time. At the same time, various design variants of the flat-plate collector are analysed in the <a href="http://www.buildingphysics.com/index-filer/heat2.htm" nofollow>Heat2</a> simulation program with regard to the maximum edge seal temperature in the event of stagnation. These results are used to determine the equivalent load duration of the edge seal at high temperatures in Central and Southern Europe. In addition, the influence of the design variants on the total heat loss at the collector is determined.
