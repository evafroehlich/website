      I projected belt dryer systems for applications in the chemical and food industry worldwide. My tasks included establishing quotations and engineering dry processes. I managed projects from start to finish. Part of it was defining the project's goal with the customers on site followed by the specifications of the dryer system. This also included choosing component suppliers and change management.
