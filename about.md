          beta GmbH is an energy contractor which supplies customers with heat &amp; electricity from small CHP plants in domestic areas. As a contractor beta GmbH carries out consulting, planning, financing and operation of the energy systems. In addition beta GmbH operates their own heating stations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among other tasks I manage and monitor maintenance optimization of the existing heating stations as well as the entire planning of new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my daily work I am also mainly responsible for the regulatory framework of CHP plants. This includes the EEG, EnEff, EnEv, KWKG, EnStG, StromStG and EnWG.

          I projected belt dryer systems for applications in the chemical and food industry worldwide. My tasks included establishing quotations and engineering dry processes. I managed projects from start to finish. Part of it was defining the project's goal with the customers on site followed by the specifications of the dryer system. This also included choosing component suppliers and change management.
