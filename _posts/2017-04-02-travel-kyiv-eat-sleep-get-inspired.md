In my last post, I gave you some tips getting to Kyiv and around. Now I will come to the essential questions of traveling: where to eat and sleep? During my short stay, I mostly followed recommendations of locals. You can also use the common rating platforms for hotels and restaurants.
Finally, I prefer to inspire you with some pictures of the city rather than telling you what sights there are - every travel guide lists them.

### Where to eat?
*Note: In Kyiv, you will find a (mobile) coffee bar on almost every corner. I don't know which can be recommended - I'd just follow the crowds.*

#### Milk Bar, Shota Rustaveli St, 16

The milk bar is located between Taras Shevchenko University and Palace of Sports. It serves milk (haha), third wave coffee and all kinds of food from breakfast to dinner. I didn't meet Alex, though. Find more details [here](http://milkbar.com.ua/en).

#### Pliacky Lviv, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho vulytsia 10

The city of Lviv is famous for its strudel so going to one of the Pliacky Lviv Cafés is very recommended. There are a few of these stores in Kyiv so remember the logo from [their webpage](http://www.pliacky.lviv.ua/).

#### O'Panas, Tereshhenkovskaya St., 10

At O'Panas you will get traditional Ukrainian food. It's located in the Taras Shevchenko Park next to the university. Find our more [here](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d1101962-Reviews-O_Panas-Kiev.html).  
Attention: The honey cake is to die for!

#### Krym, Shevchenka prov. 1 

Krym restaurant is a very cozy place with a wide range of traditional food (and honey cake!). It's located near Independence Square. Find our more [here](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d1644107-Reviews-Krym-Kiev.html).

#### Puzata Hata, various locations 

[Puzata Hata](http://www.puzatahata.com.ua/eng/) is a canteen-like restaurant which you find at different locations in Kyiv. It offers a wide range of Ukrainian and international dishes. It's a really good option if you travel on a budget and still want to taste all kinds of local food.

### Where to stay?
#### CITYHOTEL, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho str. 56A 

The [CITYHOTEL](http://cityhotel.ua/en) is a 4*-hotel located in the historic city center of Kyiv. It's in walking distance to all major sights. The hotel has a very high standard with spacious rooms and beautiful décor. I only had breakfast at the restaurant on the 14th floor. Which not only was delicious but also offered an amazing view over the city. The staff is very friendly and I enjoyed staying there.

#### Hotel Ukraine, Instytutska Str. 4

The [Hotel Ukraine](http://www.ukraine-hotel.kiev.ua/en/) is another 4*-hotel but it's not the same category as the CITYHOTEL. It is an old hotel (1912) and all rooms have been renovated (not too recently, though). The room comes without a safe.  
The location of the hotel is also very central. From you room you look over the Independence Square where you the revolution took place.
