Have you ever planned to travel to Kyiv or Ukraine? Well, it hasn't been on my bucket list so far.
After I have been invited by the Women's Energy Club to Kyiv, I wondered why Kyiv never occurred to me as a travel location.
Thinking about Ukraine   Crimea-Crisis, Euromaidan, Orange Revolution, Tschernobyl and the Klitschko Brothers come to my mind. Not much to be honest but a lot of politics. I didn't spare a thought about the city that dates backs at least 1,400 years and it's culture treasures it inherits. Ukraine alone has seven World Heritage Sites and in Kyiv, you find one (at two sites): [Kiev Pechersk Lavra](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kiev_Pechersk_Lavra) and [Saint Sophia's Cathedral](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Saint_Sophia%27s_Cathedral,_Kiev). 
So, as soon as I saw the invitation to Kyiv I knew: take the chance - go there - it has to be an amazing city.
And it was amazing - that's for sure.

Everyone I met was very welcoming and gave me a lot of tips what to do in Kyiv. So besides my official reason for visiting I had time to explore the city.  
Since I neither speak Ukrainian or Russian or read Cyrillic the following review is based on my absence of knowledge.  
Here you find some tips for your trip to Kiev:

### How to get there? 
![Cover_Picture](/img/20170330_cover4.jpg "Berlin from Airplane")
#### Air
[Ukraine International Airlines](http://www.flyuia.com/assets/images/map_november.pdf) flies directly from almost every airport hub in Europe as well from e.g. Bangkok, Dubai or New York. Travel time from Berlin to Kyiv takes is about 2 hours.
#### Bus
Some European bus lines offer trips e.g. from Berlin to Kyiv. It takes about 21 hours. 
#### Train
The train trip even takes more time: 23 hours from Berlin to Kyiv (via Warszawa).

### Getting around

*Note: To get to the metro station or cross some of the main streets you have to go - guess what - underground. Once submerged you find unexpected underground markets. Charmin, but quite confusing because there are no obvious (readable) signs to your exit. But no worries: Worst thing that can happen is that you find yourself emerging where you started.*

#### By Foot 
Most of the city center and the old town can be reached by foot, therefore, I rarely used transportation. I recommend downloading the "CityMaps 2Go" - App by Ulmon GmbH. Mostly walking the city by myself no one noticed I am a tourist. Of course, if you speak a foreign language you are identified by merchants. They e.g. offer you making a picture with a pigeon or a monkey on a leash - just don't. 
Luckily, I have only experienced these touristy things on the main shopping street: **Kreschatyk St.** where you find second boardwalk closer to the street with no one trying to sell random objects.

#### Metro  
![Metro_Station_Kyiv](/img/20170330_metrostationkyiv.jpg "Metro Station")
Kyiv has [3 metro lines](http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/ua/kiev/kyiv.htm). You can buy the tickets at the entrance (ticket kiosk or automat), Price will be 4 UAH (15 cents) wherever you go. The station and metros are very busy so be aware of pickpocketing. **Goto** the deepest metro station in the world: Arsenalna Metro Station.

#### Funicular  
![Funicular_Kyiv](/img/20170330_funicular.jpg "Funicular")
My favorite transport. The cable cars are from 1905 and connect the lower district Podol with the upper part of Kyiv. Price ist 3 UAH (10 cents) per ride.

#### Bus  
You will find bus station all over the place. The ticket Price is 3 UAH (10 cents)for one ride. Ít can be bought at little shops near bus stops, from the bus driver or salesperson on the bus. You have to buy it immediately and stamp your ticket. Hold on to your belongings - again - it can get very crowded.

#### Taxi
[Uklon Taxi Service](https://www.uklon.com.ua/) is the Ukrainian version of a well known private taxi company. You can order a taxi beforehand online or just via the App (available for iOS and android). As a feature the app tells you in advance how much the trip will cost.  
Note that drivers use their private cars so it won't always be the newest model.  
Of course, there's also a Public Taxi Service with private and company run taxis..

#### Other Options (I didn't use)  
Tram (from 1892), Elektritshka, regular Taxis

### Where to eat?
*Note: In Kyiv, you will find a mobile coffee bar on almost every corner. I don't know which ones to recommend - just follow the crowds.*

#### Milk Bar, Shota Rustaveli St, 16

The milk bar is located between Taras Shevchenko University and Palace of Sports. It serves milk (haha), third wave coffee and all kinds of food from breakfast to dinner. I didn't meet Alex, though.  Find more details [here](http://milkbar.com.ua/en).

#### Pliacky Lviv, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho vulytsia 10

The city of Lviv is famous for its strudel so going to one of the Pliacky Lviv Cafés is very recommended. There are a few of these stores in Kyiv so remember the logo from [their webpage](http://www.pliacky.lviv.ua/).

#### O'Panas, Tereshhenkovskaya St., 10

At O'Panas you will get traditional Ukrainian food. It's located in the Taras Shevchenko Park next to the university. Find our more [here](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d1101962-Reviews-O_Panas-Kiev.html).  
Attention: The honey cake is to die for!

##### Krym, Shevchenka prov. 1 

Krym restaurant is a very cozy place with a wide range of traditional food (and honey cake!). It's located near Independence Square. Find our more [here](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d1644107-Reviews-Krym-Kiev.html).

### Where to stay?
#### CITYHOTEL, Bohdana Khmelnytskoho str. 56A 

The [CITYHOTEL](http://cityhotel.ua/en) is a 4*-hotel located in the historic city center of Kyiv. It's in walking distance to all major sights. The hotel has a very high standard with spacious rooms and beautiful décor. I only had breakfast at the restaurant on the 14th floor. Which not only was delicious but also offered an amazing view over the city. The staff is very friendly and I enjoyed staying there.

#### Hotel Ukraine, Instytutska Str. 4

The [Hotel Ukraine](http://www.ukraine-hotel.kiev.ua/en/) is another 4*-hotel but it's not the same category as the CITYHOTEL. It is an old hotel (1912) and all rooms have been renovated (not too recently, though). The room comes without a safe.  
The location of the hotel is also very central. From you room you look over the Independence Square where you the revolution took place.

### Kyiv Inspirations

There is a lot to do in Kyiv. I skipped the museums and took advantage of the good weather.
