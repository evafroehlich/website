### What is the Women's Energy Club of Ukraine?
[WECU](http://www.wecu.com.ua/en/) is a non-governmental organization founded to unite women professionals working in the energy sector for mutually beneficial cooperation and empowerment, to create a platform for dialogue and increase the percentage of women employed in this sector.
As a result of the military aggression of the Russian Federation, the elderly, women and children suffer the most from the horrific actions. Therefore, WECU considers it necessary to help more vulnerable groups to adapt to new living conditions.

There are many women professionals in the energy sector in Ukraine who have been forced to save their children's lives, leave their homes and seek refuge outside their country. 

I am gathering up-to-date information on employment opportunities for Ukrainian women in the energy sector in Germany and Europe. 

### Locations
WECU members have found refuge in the following countries:

Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine 

Do you know any women's energy network in these countries? The WECU and I would be happy if you can share our inquiry in your respective network. 

### Do you have any employment opportunities to offer?  
If yes, please feel free to contact me with the following profile:

- Company Name
- Offered position (+ weblink)
- Trusted Contact Person in the Company
- Skill requirements

### Do you want to chip in and offer local support for women? 
One of the first things they need is reliable information about registration and residence. 

### How to proceed?
I currently take the role as a “middle-woman” or network connector if you may say. Please send all job offers and support offers to this [address](mailto:
wecu-backup-network@mailbox.org).


I will share the info with the WECU organizers, who then will share them within their network. As soon as we have a match the WECU will get in touch with the contact person in the company and/or the person offering further support.
