      I'm an engineer from Berlin!
    </p>

    <p>
      I have expertise in different field of
      <em>renewable energy</em>
      and
      <em>mechanical engineering</em>.
      The projects I worked with included
      <em><abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr></em>,
      <em>storage</em> solution,
      <em>solar thermal</em>,
      <em>wave</em> and
      <em>wind energy</em> systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renewable Energies are necessary to ensure a sustainable future. As an engineer I believe in innovative energy management and concepts to integrate energy efficient technology in our daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm an open-minded person who loves to study new technologies and approaches. The balance between scientific research and applied technology is important to me.
