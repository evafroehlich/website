    <h1>Hi, I'm Eva-Christin Ernst!</h1>
    <h2>I'm an engineer from Berlin!</h2>

    <p>
      I have expertise in different fields of
      <b>renewable energy</b>
      and
      <b>mechanical engineering</b>.
      The projects I worked with included
      <b><abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr></b>,
      <b>storage</b> solutions,
      <b>solar thermal</b>,
      <b>wave</b> and
      <b>wind energy</b> systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renewable Energies are necessary to ensure a sustainable future. As an engineer I believe in innovative energy management and concepts to integrate energy efficient technology in our daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm an open-minded person who loves to study new technologies and approaches. The balance between scientific research and applied technology is important to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advocate for equal opportunities for all genders. As a member of "hypatia - Frauennetzwerk Erneuerbare Energien und Cleantech e.V." and "Women of Windenergy Deutschland e.V." I am part of a growing network of amazing women supporting each other in the professional context.
