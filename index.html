    I have expertise in various areas of
    <b>renewable energy</b>
    and
    <b>mechanical engineering</b>.
    The projects I've worked on include heat pumps,<abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> systems,
    energy storage solutions, cooling systems, solar thermal, wave and wind energy systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Renewable energy</b> is essential for a sustainable future. As an
    engineer, I believe in innovative energy management and smart concepts that integrate
    energy-efficient technologies into our everyday lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a well-organized and efficient <b>project manager</b>. I believe that open communication with all stakeholders is key to a project's success. I take pride in working with a strong sense of responsibility, independence, and a high level of self-organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a <b>team leader</b>, itâ€™s important to me that my team has the tools and knowledge they need to thrive. Supporting each other, being open-minded and respectful, and maintaining a sense of humor are essential values in a successful team. I see each team member as an individual who works independently and takes ownership of their projects. This combination of personal responsibility and knowing that support is always available is what makes our team strong.
  </p>  
  <p>
  I'm an <b>open-minded person</b> who enjoys exploring and applying new technologies and approaches. I value the balance between scientific research and practical application. I also really enjoy managing and leading. Every day brings new challenges. I like using intuition and clear thinking to guide people and projects. Supporting others and creating clarity feels meaningful to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I advocate for equal opportunities across all genders. As a member of women's networks in the energy sector, I'm fortunate to be surrounded by inspiring women who support one another in their careers.
