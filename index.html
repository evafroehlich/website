  <h1 class="home__headline">Hi, I'm an engineer from Berlin!</h1>

  <p>
    I have expertise in different fields of
    <b>renewable energy</b>
    and
    <b>mechanical engineering</b>.
    The projects I worked with included
    <b><abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr></b>,
    <b>storage</b> solutions,
    <b>solar thermal</b>,
    <b>wave</b> and
    <b>wind energy</b> systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Renewable Energies are necessary to ensure a sustainable future. As an
    engineer I believe in innovative energy management and concepts to integrate
    energy efficient technology in our daily life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm an open-minded person who loves to study new technologies and
    approaches. The balance between scientific research and applied technology
    is important to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I advocate for equal opportunities for all genders. As a member of "hypatia
    - Frauennetzwerk Erneuerbare Energien und Cleantech e.V." and [Women of New Energies e.V.](https://womenofnewenergies.wildapricot.org/) I am part of a growing network of amazing women
    supporting each other in the professional context.
